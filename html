<h2 class="font-size-15"><b>Where your Personal Information will be held</b></h2>
<p>We store your Personal Information in data centres located in United States and backed up in United States. SHL affiliates also transfer your Personal Information within the Europe Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”).</p>
<p>Additionally, your Personal Information is transferred to the United States, India, South Africa and United Kingdom (“<strong>SHL Non EEA Processing Locations</strong>”) where a limited number of personnel in our SHL Non EEA Processing Locations, as well as our trusted third party vendors and service providers, have access to Personal Information in order to provide services. As the SHL Non EEA Processing Locations are in countries which do not have equivalent data protection laws to those applicable in the EEA we have an Intragroup Agreement in place, signed by all SHL affiliates, which contains the European Union (<strong>EU</strong>) Standard Contractual Clauses (<strong>SCCs</strong>) which have been approved by the EU data protection authorities for the transfer of data outside the EEA. Our third party vendors and service providers are also required to sign up to SCCs in accordance with Article 46 of the General Data Protection Regulation. All SHL affiliates have the same technical, physical, and administrative security controls and are required to comply with our data protection policies and procedures, applicable laws, governing the collection and use of personal information.</p>
<p>We are happy to provide you with copies of the regulator-approved SCCs, which you can request from the SHL Data Protection Officer (DPO) on <a href="mailto:dpo@shl.com">dpo@shl.com</a> or the contact details included at the end of this Notice</p>
